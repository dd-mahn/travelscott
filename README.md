## Modern Travel Experience Platform
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89c98a40-0e47-4aae-9a58-7eac3cda9b1d)

A modern, full-stack travel platform providing immersive destination guides, travel planning tools, and personalized recommendations with a focus on exceptional user experience and visual storytelling.

Why I built this project: I started learning web development seriously in May 2023. After a period of learning, I worked on several different projects and eventually progressed to my first full-stack project: a booking website. Although the project wasn't perfect, it was meaningful to me, and during this time, I was also exposed to modern websites (from Awwwards, Curated Design, etc.). This inspired me to revisit the project with the goal of building a website on my own that would offer a great user experience, from ideation and design to coding, testing, and optimization. It has been a long journey, but I achieved my goal.

Please note that this project lacks certain user-facing features like accounts and booking functionality, as that was not the focus of my initial idea. It is simply an informational website with a fresh user interface experience.

Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy my project!
